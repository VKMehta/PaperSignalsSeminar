# Paper Signals, CU MakerSpace Seminar

Columbia University MakerSpace ("CUMakersSpace") seminar derived from Googleâ€™s 2017 [Paper Signals](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/#) experiment. This project provides a solid entry into an IoT (Internet of Things) framework and mindset, and is applicable to users and makers of any skill level. Please read [Google's tutorial](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) for any information that may have been overlooked and for any updates that have not (yet) been included in this adaptation.

In above the link to Google's tutorial, there is a website with descriptive videos, clear context, and a very good motivation for this seminar. It is recommended that you read, watch, and mesh with the vibe of that website before continuing on with the rest of this tutorial (~7 min. of reading from this point).

## Things You Need

You will definitely need a phone with Google Assistant installed (so a phone running iOS or Android. Are there really still people reading this not using one of those two mobile operating systems? Anyway, the age of three competing mobile OS's is gone for the time being.).

### Electronic

As of December 03, 2017 there exists a ~$25 bundle on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3022) recommended by Google that includes all the necessary electronic components for this seminar.

Should the above bundle become unavailable, equivalent products on Adafruit are provided below:

  - [Microcontroller board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3046)
  - [Small servo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/169)
  - [Jumper wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1953)
  - [Connector cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

### Paper Materials

- Thicker paper (80-100 lb. card-stock. Everything will be housed inside a card-stock structure. You want it to feel nice tactically, look good visually, and support itself structurally. Think more business-card-paper and less textbook-page-paper.)
- Sticky stuff (glue)

### Software Required

- [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com)
- [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/manuals/software) for Ultimaker 3D printers
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [USB Driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) to communicate with microcontroller board

### Tools

- Vinyl cutter
- Paper cutting tool
  - Straight edge cutting tool
  - Alternatively: Scissors
- 3D printer
- 2D printer (ie., an actual, 2D paper printer ðŸ˜‰)
- Screwdriver (probably something small-diameter since we're working with small microntroller boards. Also preferably Phillips-head)
- Narrow point to score folds (eg., empty mechanical pencil, a nail, back edge of an X-ACTO blade, same screwdriver from above, etc.)
- Ruler

## Instructions

For now, we will follow the literal [instructions from Google](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted#get-the-parts). The reason I say that is because their instructions have very, very pretty pictures and very, very pretty slideshows, so it makes sense to follow their lead for now.

## TODO

- More detailed instructions to design parts created in MakerSpace
    - Replace most (if not all) paper cut with separate parts from 3D SketchUp tutorials or parts that can be cut from the laser cutter
- Reduce dependency on Google hosted tutorial

## Acknowledgements

This seminar was _very_ much derived from Googleâ€™s own, aforementioned [tutorial](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) by the aforementioned creators. So much credit for this endeavor is owed to work done by creators [Nicole](https://github.com/nicolehe) and [Dan](https://github.com/dmotz), and I cannot thank them enough for the amazing and accessible work they have provided.

## Be Kind Clause by VK (aka "Don't Be A Dick Addendum")

Further use of any "material" (code, language, images, etc. [anything deemed as such and appropriate by a future court]) from this work should be accompanied by a license to promote its free use, and to accredit its original authors appropriately (See *Authors* section above). There is no binding financial, legal, or otherwise material agreement accompanying this clause. It is simply an attempt to allow knowledge and information to be used in good faith among the public and for the greater good, and to attribute authors for their work, effort, and foresight. Current events and contemporary situations will always make it difficult to evaluate the intent of any given language in legalese, and one can only hope that such intent are understood as they were derived and applied in the sense in which they were created. Inclusion of a similar clause, or any message, to the same effect as the above, in any work derived from this work, would be appreciated by the original forker (VKMehta).

Please, be kind.
