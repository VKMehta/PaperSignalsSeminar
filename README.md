# Paper Signals, CUMakerSpace Seminar

Columbia University MakerSpace ("CUMakerSpace") seminar derived from Googleâ€™s 2017 [Paper Signals](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/#) experiment. This project provides a solid entry into an IoT (Internet of Things) framework and mindset, and is applicable to users and makers of any skill level. Please read [Google's tutorial](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) for any information that may have been overlooked, and for any updates that have not (yet) been included in this adaptation for the [Columbia University MakerSpace](make.columbia.edu).

In Google's explanation video above-- which I highly recommend you watch-- there are descriptive videos, a clear context, and a very good motivation for this seminar. It is recommended that you read, watch, and mesh with the vibe of [Google's Voice Experiment's website](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/voice), or have some interest in IoT development before continuing on with the rest of this tutorial (~7 min. of reading from this point). Please reference [the Google tutorial for Paper Signals](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) until this document is updated with a complete walkthrough of the material.

## Prereqs

Firstly, if you haven't already seen [this project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJXYSfnxuQ) by Google, please watch it.

Next, in order to configure your device, you will definitely need a device capable of running [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com) and logged into your Google Account.

### Electronic

As of December 03, 2017 there exists a ~$25 bundle on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3022) recommended by Google that includes all the necessary electronic components for this seminar.

Should the above bundle become unavailable, equivalent products on Adafruit are provided below:

  - [Microcontroller board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3046)
  - [Small servo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/169)
  - [Jumper wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1953)
  - [Connector cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

### Paper Materials

- Thicker paper (80-100 lb. card-stock. Everything will be housed inside a card-stock structure. You want it to feel nice tactically, look good visually, and support itself structurally. Think more business-card-paper and less textbook-page-paper.)
- Sticky stuff (glue)

### Software Required

- [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com)
- [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/manuals/software) for Ultimaker 3D printers
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [USB Driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) to communicate with microcontroller board

Note: See [the Google tutorial here for Paper Signals here](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) for installation instructions and how to obtain the relevant API keys needed.

### Tools

- Vinyl cutter
- Paper cutting tool
  - Straight edge cutting tool
  - Alternatively: Scissors
- 3D printer
- 2D printer (ie., an actual, 2D paper printer ðŸ˜‰)
- Screwdriver (probably something small-diameter since we're working with small microntroller boards. Also preferably Phillips-head)
- Narrow point to score folds (eg., empty mechanical pencil, a nail, back edge of an X-ACTO blade, same screwdriver from above, etc.)
- Ruler

## Instructions

For now, we will follow the literal [instructions from Google](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted#get-the-parts). The reason I say that is because their instructions have very, very pretty pictures and very, very pretty slideshows, so it makes sense to follow their lead for now.

## TODO

- Replace most (if not all) paper cut with separate parts from 3D SketchUp tutorials or parts that can be cut from the laser cutter
  - Servo enclosure
  - Other shared parts
  - Signal specific parts (ie umbrella rotation attachment)

## Acknowledgements

This seminar was _very_ much derived from Googleâ€™s own, aforementioned [tutorial](https://papersignals.withgoogle.com/getstarted) by the aforementioned creators. So much credit for this endeavor is owed to work done by creators [Nicole](https://github.com/nicolehe) and [Dan](https://github.com/dmotz), and I cannot thank them enough for the amazing and accessible work they have provided.
